# Day 1 Summary

## Project Overview
On **Day 1** of my FastAPI project, I began by setting up the basic structure of the application. My first step was to create a FastAPI instance, which would serve as the core of the project.

## Key Activities

### 1. Setup FastAPI Instance
- Created the initial FastAPI instance to handle incoming requests.

### 2. Implemented CORS Middleware
- Configured **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** middleware to allow requests from any origin. This is crucial for testing and future integrations.

### 3. Created Home Route
- Developed a simple home route that returns a greeting message, confirming that the setup was functioning correctly.

### 4. Added Greeting Endpoint
- Implemented an endpoint to accept optional parameters for the user's **name** and **age**, making the API more interactive.

### 5. Developed Book Creation Endpoint
- Set up a **POST** endpoint for creating book entries, using a serialization model to validate incoming data and ensure data integrity.

### 6. Header Retrieval Endpoint
- Created an endpoint to retrieve and display various **HTTP headers** from incoming requests, useful for debugging and understanding client interactions.
